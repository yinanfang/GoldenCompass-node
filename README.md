# To-dos
- git
  - git model with: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
- Build system
  - Exact token and credentials in config.js to a env file. Copy the env file before starting node with env file. Don't commit env file.

- Log with winston
  - GCLog
  - move Loggly script from LikeIt repo. Use winston the Loggly
  - create new if not exist or append to existing log file: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28924835/node-js-winston-can-i-append-log
  - Add https://github.com/visionmedia/debug to log.js
- Deployment
  - Development mode
    - nodemon -debug app.js
  - Production mode with pm2
    - pm2 start with json add log files for output and errors.
    - start pm2 with config file
  - Continuous Deployment with Webfaction

    - Production mode with pm2 node balance mode -i 0: http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/cluster-mode/
  - post-receive problem
    - Can't do npm install on post-receive?
    - pm2 will be execute from git/LikeIt.git so express's views path will be wrong. How to pretend it's started from likeit/app?
    - Just do reload instead of delete+start! https://keymetrics.io/2015/03/26/pm2-clustering-made-easy/

    - [ ] Backup after a successful update of DB. Use it to restore if something goes wrong next time
  - Don't use user email as id, use userID. DB table prefix. dotenv. brosersync proxy port, get from env|config

#### Structure

  - GoldenCompass
    - app.js
    - app
      - api
      - model
      - db
      - view

- [ ] Build with Facebook [Flux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS188xDYE-u1ShQmFFGbrk0v&t=602&v=nYkdrAPrdcw) & React
  - MVC doesn't scale
    - MVC is pretty good for small application. Everything has its particular roll to play. The problem is that it doesn't make room for the new features
    - Increase predictability
    - MVC allows bi-direction data flow, but Flux allows only one direction data flow
    - When data changes, React re-renders the component
    - Referentially transparent functions
      - Describe UI at any point in time
      - Trivial to predict for a given input
      - Easy to test
    - React builds a new virtual DOM subtree
      - diffs it with the old one
      - computes the minimal set of DOM mutations and puts them in a queue
      - and batch executes all updates
    - Might worries about the performance if only a small changes occurs in a huge DOM tree. There're a lot of useless diffs



#### Architecture

1. Authentication
  - [x] Choose [Json Web Token over Session](https://auth0.com/blog/2014/01/27/ten-things-you-should-know-about-tokens-and-cookies/) with [Bcrypt](dcodeIO/bcrypt.js) Encryption
2. [JWT Advantage](https://scotch.io/tutorials/the-anatomy-of-a-json-web-token#what-are-json-web-tokens?)
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT), pronounced ‚Äújot‚Äù, are a standard since the information they carry is transmitted via JSON. We can read more about the draft, but that explanation isn‚Äôt the most pretty to look at.
  - JSON Web Tokens work across different programming languages: JWTs work in .NET, Python, Node.js, Java, PHP, Ruby, Go, JavaScript, and Haskell. So you can see that these can be used in many different scenarios.
  - JWTs are self-contained: They will carry all the information necessary within itself. This means that a JWT will be able to transmit basic information about itself, a payload (usually user information), and a signature.
  - JWTs can be passed around easily: Since JWTs are self-contained, they are perfectly used inside an HTTP header when authenticating an API. You can also pass it through the URL.
  - Authentication with JWT because
